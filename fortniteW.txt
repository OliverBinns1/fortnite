[Intro]
I'm really bored, and right now I don't want to play Fortnite. So I decided to write a song about it. And you know what? It's a banger! So smash a like, and let me tell you a story about a little game called Fortnite

[Verse 1]
Console, PC, didn't matter to me
Season one just begun, we were all noobie
First drop, no kills, second drop, big thrills
I'm addicted, you're addicted, back to the lobby

[Verse 2]
Season two came around, Tilted is our new hometown
New skins, game wins, can't put the game down
30 bombs, good memes, Ninja, Twitch.tv
Rocket rides, good snipes, we love Fortnite!


[Chorus]
Fortnite's kinda dying
It was always fine until we started trying
Fortnite's kinda dying
But we play the game and then we close it crying

[Verse 3]
So, season three, back bling, meteor conspiracy
John Wick, sick clips, double pumps fixed (Shit)
Take the L, raging, turbo building
Updates, best mates, battle of the greats
Season four, meteor, map changes please no more
Game changes, alterations, outrages, expectations
Season five, we survived, season six, swing and miss
Season seven, Armageddon, Fortnite just ain't getting better!

[Chorus]
Fortnite's kinda dying
It was always fine until we started trying
Fortnite's kinda dying
But we play the game and then we close it crying

[Verse 4]
Planes, ballers, brutes, swords, I can't take it any more
C4, zombies, 0 ping, cranking
Dynamite, box fights, mechs trending worldwide
Aim assist, arguments, season X oh what a time!
Oh, oh my god!
Siphon, redeploy, all the things we did enjoy
Bounce pads halted, 'cause if it's fun it's vaulted
Fun game thrown away, people quitting everyday
How long do I have to wait to see this game be fun again?
